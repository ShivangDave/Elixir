## ⭐️ Day off
> March 30, 2021
>
> `Keeping up the pace` sounds easy when you're able to focus on the task on hand full time. Part time? Realllyyyyyy difficult. I realize this as I feel a little burnout. So I think I'm going to take today off from studying and refocus.

## ⭐️ Almost there? 🥲
> March 29, 2021
>
> While it feels like an eternity, it really does make a difference when you go and learn basics first. Almost ready to start experimenting with `Elixir`.
>
> I didn't get a chance to pickup the pace. So I only able to review `Binaries` and `Date & Time` modules. While they're fun to play with, I'll only be able evaluate it once I get to implementation. 
>
> As always, you can find the notes on GitHub. I really feel that I wouldn't be making such progress without the book. Cannot recommend it enough.

## ⭐️ And then Sunday happened.
> March 28, 2021
>
> Oh man, I understand now how my students would feel studying on a sunday. I did manage to get a little productive for the sake of it and wrapped up `Lists` and `Maps`.
>
> So similar but so different compared to `Arrays` and `Hashes (Objects in JS)`. I like 'em. On to the `Binaries` we go!

## ⭐️ More Basics... More Fun.. ish..
> March 27, 2021 
> 
> Studying on a saturday doesn't feel quite right. But I did wrap up `Value Types`. Learning about `System Types` was a walk down memory lane. Reminded me of all the code I wrote for multi-threaded apps in `C++` during one of my master's degree classes.  
> 
> `Collection Types` in elixir are just a tad different than what I was anticipating. But the weekend vibes aren't going to go away easily. Hopefully I can resume tomorrow starting with learning about `Lists`.
>  
> Notes are still upto date on `main` branch if you want 'em 🤘🏻

> Vaccine day hit really hard. Didn't really get much done today. Went over some elixir basics. Started by learning about overall `Built In Types`. Followed by diving deeper into `Value Types` subcategory.
>
> Prepared some good notes on `Integers`, `Atoms`, `Ranges` and `RegEx`. Good stuff.

> When it comes to `functional programming`, the statement firmly holds true. Writing code for processes that run parallel to each other and making sure that they don't mess up the `data` and `synchronization` is where elixir really shines. 
>
> Today I went over `Immutability` and how it simplifies things for us. Learning about `immutability` also explained how deep the idea of `Data Transformation` is rooted in elixir. In addition to all of this, I also went over how `immutability` affects the efficiency! 🤯

## ⭐️ Getting the website up
> March 24, 2021 
> 
> Today I didn't really get a chance to work on new concepts. Kind of a busy day. Instead, I dedicated some time on getting this page up so that I can blog about the chapters that I go through easily and present it in a prettier format. Kudos to GitHub for building tools such as GitHub Pages which made it really easy to get this page up.

## ⭐️ The `=` sign isn't the `=` sign anymore! More or less. 
> March 23, 2021 
> 
> Well, well, well. Remember when we used the `=` sign to store values into / assign variables? If you don't, you're going to do just fine in elixir. Turns out, `pattern matching` is a big deal. The `=` sign, formally known as `assignment operator` doesn't do assignment no more.

> In elixir, `=` sign is known as **`match`** operator. And instead of assignment, it's all about inference now. Very interesting! I thoroughly enjoyed this chapter. If you want to look at my notes and the exercises, you can find the link in the table below. In this section, I also learned some rules of pattern matching.

## ⭐️ IO.puts "Hello World ☀️"
> March 22, 2021 
> 
> I wanted 2021 to be a lot different than 2020. So I decided that I'm going to try and experiment with as many languages & platforms as I can. It is definitely going to be an interesting journey and for no specific reason, I'm going to document all of it 🤔 I'm going to try and do everything by the books (cuz I miss reading books!) 📚 I'll be referring to [Programming Elixir 1.6] for the most part.

> Today, I didn't really get a chance to go over a lot of stuff. Just the [Setup] & some [Intro]. Coming straight from JS, Functional programming isn't new to me. Here's a list of few things that I've observed so far!
>
> - **Things I like 👍🏻 already:**
>   - Syntax (I've played around with Python & Ruby alot hence syntax is really easy to follow.)
>   - `iex` CLI tool (Again, `irb` in ruby is pretty similar.)
>   - Documentation is solid!
>
> - **Things I don't like 👎🏻 as much:**
>   - Stepping away from the idea of storing variables and stepping into pattern matching. (Don't know what that is yet! But do not like the sound of it.) 
> 
> - **Things I'm most excited 😍 about:** 
>   - Stepping away from the idea of Object Orientation
>   - Reinforcing my understanding about Multi-threaded coding
>   - I get a feeling that learning elixir would help me improve my vanilla JS best practices
>
> Can't wait to take a deeper dive! 🤓
