## 3. Getting the website up
> March 24, 2021 
> 
> Today I didn't really get a chance to work on new concepts. Kind of a busy day. Instead, I dedicated some time on getting this page up so that I can blog about the chapters that I go through easily and present it in a prettier format. Kudos to GitHub for building tools such as GitHub Pages which made it really easy to get this page up.

> Still going to be using markdown to write these blogs. But atleast they're going to look prettier than the usual `.md` preview.

## 2. The `=` sign isn't the `=` sign anymore! More or less. 
> March 23, 2021 
> 
> Well, well, well. Remember when we used the `=` sign to store values into / assign variables? If you don't, you're going to do just fine in elixir. Turns out, `pattern matching` is a big deal. The `=` sign, formally known as `assignment operator` doesn't do assignment no more.
>
> In elixir, `=` sign is known as **`match`** operator. And instead of assignment, it's all about inference now. Very interesting! I thoroughly enjoyed this chapter. If you want to look at my notes and the exercises, you can find the link in the table below. In this section, I also learned some rules of pattern matching.

## 1. IO.puts "Hello World ☀️"
> March 22, 2021 
> 
> As my 2021 thing, I'm going to try and experiment with as many platforms as I can. It is definitely going to be an interesting journey and for no specific reason, I'm going to document all of it 🤔 I'll be doing everything by the book 📚 Like literally! My notes are derived from [Programming Elixir 1.6] for the most part.

> Today, I didn't really get a chance to go over a lot of stuff. Just the [Setup] & some [Intro]. Coming straight from JS, Functional programming isn't new to me. Here's a list of few things that I've observed so far!
>
> - **Things I like 👍🏻 already:**
>   - Syntax (I've played around with Python & Ruby alot hence syntax is really easy to follow.)
>   - `iex` CLI tool (Again, `irb` in ruby is pretty similar.)
>   - Documentation is solid!
>
> - **Things I don't like 👎🏻 as much:**
>   - Stepping away from the idea of storing variables and stepping into pattern matching. (Don't know what that is yet! But do not like the sound of it.) 
> 
> - **Things I'm most excited 😍 about:** 
>   - Stepping away from the idea of Object Orientation
>   - Reinforcing my understanding about Multi-threaded coding
>   - I get a feeling that learning elixir would help me improve my vanilla JS best practices
>
> Can't wait to take a deeper dive! 🤓
