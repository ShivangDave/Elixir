> As my 2021 thing, I'm going to try and experiment with as many platforms as I can. It is definitely going to be an interesting journey and for no specific reason, I'm going to document all of it 🤔 I'll be doing everything by the book 📚 Like literally! My notes are derived from [Programming Elixir 1.6] for the most part.

> Today, I didn't really get a chance to go over a lot of stuff. Just the [Setup] & some [Intro]. Coming straight from JS, Functional programming isn't new to me. Here's a list of few things that I've observed so far!
>
> - **Things I like 👍🏻 already:**
>   - Syntax (I've played around with Python & Ruby alot hence syntax is really easy to follow.)
>   - `iex` CLI tool (Again, `irb` in ruby is pretty similar.)
>   - Documentation is solid!
>
> - **Things I don't like 👎🏻 as much:**
>   - Stepping away from the idea of storing variables and stepping into pattern matching. 
> 
> - **Things I'm most excited 😍 about:** 
>   - Stepping away from the idea of Object Orientation
>   - Reinforcing my understanding about Multi-threaded coding
>   - I get a feeling that learning elixir would help me improve my vanilla JS best practices
>
> Can't wait to take a deeper dive! 🤓
