# 🔬 Elixir 🧪

#### Why? 🤨

2020 was 🐕💩 and exhausting. But I did manage to dip my toes into a lot of new cool stuff. I didn't really document anything.

So in 2021, I'm going to try and experiment with as many platforms as I can. It is definitely going to be an interesting journey. Also, I'm going to document all of it [here](https://shivangdave.github.io/elixir).
